        <p>I'm a super hero with the transcendental powers of playing Dwarf Fortress and watching Star Trek TNG. I'm dipping my toes into web development, loving every small step and giant stride. I have familiarity with HTML and CSS, taking my first peek into Javascript in the next few weeks. If I had to pic a passion, the world of cybersecurity sounds tantilizing and exciting. I look forward to learning anything and everything. I love video games, so I feel like there's a lot of passion bleed from problem solving and engaging with new systems.</p>
